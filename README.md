# Challenge for Engineer Manager Possition in TrackStreet

# Overview 
First of all, thanks a lot for your time and for the possibility to participate in this process.

The original requirement is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EcjCjwwhf24XdWk6CGSIpEeBc68UEA0gLi4-hqWw0M/edit)

In this opportunity I found this challenge very interesting for me because I don't have previous experience working with crawling or scraping, so I needed to learn about it, investigate, study and dive deep into this.

In the same way, actually I am not coding daily so needed to refresh my only neuron, jajaja.

# Looking for Support
I look for support on StackOverflow (I am 41 years old, so is very common for me, go to the source of knowledge, jaja and obviosly ChatGPT).

# Tests
To ensure the robustness of the solution, I tested the app in different ways and parameters

# Bonus Points
About the bonus points i only develop the third point "Add a parameter to only crawl items in a specific condition (New, Pre-Owned, etc)."
This additional functionality adds flexibility to the solution and aligns with the challenge's objectives, and in the source code of the app you can change the parameters and get differents results.

Thank you once again for this enriching experience.!!

Have a nice day.!
Regards.
