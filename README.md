# Challenge for Engineer Manager Possition in TrackStreet

# Overview 
First of all, thanks a lot for your time and for the possibility to participate in this process.

The original requirement is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EcjCjwwhf24XdWk6CGSIpEeBc68UEA0gLi4-hqWw0M/edit)

In this opportunity I found this challenge very interesting for me because i don't have previous experience working with crawling or scraping, so I need to learn about it, investigate, study and dive deep into learning, researching, and experimenting a lot.

In the same way, acttualy I am not coding daily so need to refresh my only neuron, jajaja.

# Looking for Support
I look for support on StackOverflow (I have 41 years old, so is very common to recurr to the originals fonts of knowledge, jaja and obviosly ChatGPT)

# Tests
To ensure the robustness of the solution, I test the app and in a differents ways and parameters.

# Bonus Points
About the bonus points i only develop the third point "Add a parameter to only crawl items in a specific condition (New, Pre-Owned, etc)."

Thank you once again for this enriching experience.!!

Have a nice day.!
Regards.
Nazareno
